"*TEST 01*

Ans 1) Three common learning misconceptions:

1. Practicing without any break 
2. Re-reading
3. Highlighting


Answer 2) Familiarity Trap (when highlighting or re-reading)


Answer 3) Using Interleaving technique in my own studies:

• Day 01: Studying AI for 1hr + Analytical quizzes for 1hr + Maths for 1hr

• Day 02: Studying Psychology for 1hr + Marketing for 1hr + AI for 1hr


Ans 4) Multiple small tests.

(This has actually helped me score 97% percentage in my final exams as my subject teacher used to take weekly exams throughout the year <3)

P.S. I tried 🥲. The first question was hard.


*TEST 02*

Ans 1) Practicing by ourselves

And 2) According to meㅡgrowth mindset is about keep learning things even if we don't see results immediately, and keep working on the mistakes rather then giving up. (idk this what I think, and it's true in my case ༎ຶ⁠‿⁠༎ຶ)",-0.0

"The strategies the writer has espoused in the book are good. 
However, there are a few things to consider:
Highlighting, Rereading and Taking notes all have their place in learning, it just maybe that for most people, it won't be as effective if we make them fair against  some other strategies like spaced repetition and quizzing and others.
For example, Highlighting won't improve your memory for that info that you highlighted, yes (for most people). However, highlighting important points/topics/lines/blocks can actually help you review things quickly before exams when you are short for time. You don't wanna search trough which points are important to focus on before an exam, especially if you don't have much time to review them.
Another thing is that while highlighting won't improve your retention/memory for that particular text/block, if you have Synesthesia, then highlighting will very likely improve your retention of that piece of text. Now, yes, people with Synesthesia are relatively rare, but I thought it's better that I mention this.

Rereading can be quite helpful for glancing through concepts before an exam, but I would say ""Selective Rereading"", basically, Rereading the concepts which, for whatever reason, you forget more often than not, and concepts that are very important for that exam.

And Taking notes, again, basically helps you go through the concepts relatively quickly when you review them before an exam.

All in all though, the information provided in this book is very good, especially the ""Testing/Quizzing before learning a concept, aka, Priming"" strategy. I have used this during learning coding (JavaScript), and it really works, even though it seems counter-intuitive.",0.9633

"I do that a lot... If i compare a study guides from differernt vendors and find their cetifications are not well structured like databricks cert objectives, I dont and wont find it enticing. I like structure like bacpropagation and forward propagation confirming error correction and holding a reservior of strength and breath in the muscles with a tactile or kinetic walks for a long duration of time. Microsoft certifications have a good idea of keeping their study guide or objective in a framed, structured approach which helps in acquiring sound understanding and knowledge of the domain or workload - a cleaner form of seeing actionable pipeline or series of steps, processes or operations. A certain company are so brilliant they wanted their analytics team and newbies to be comfortable with knowing what a data pipeline is by recognising it in their study guide - their competition are just everywhere waiting for others to follow them based on their ELT big data version.",0.8962
"1) when studying feel super hard and you feel there's no progress (misconception #1) / Truth is you are learning but its subconscious .

"I really enjoy your book/education videos. More than technical learning (coding, math, music, etc.) I prefer psychology and internal transformation (mental awareness, emotional intelligence, etc.). For example, Make It Stick is far more interesting than Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell to me. In fact, I'm curious if Brown et al. discuss whether interest in the subject matter is a factor. Because I really like learning self-help techniques and applying them immediately. For example, I just read The 5-Second Rule by Mel Robbins. Basically, I have a slight shyness around people I don't know. I know, shocking. It's not horrible, but it's certainly there. After reading The 5-second Rule, I decided to test the book and went up to about 8 or 9 people independently over the last 2 weeks at my gym and asked them if they were interested in going rock climbing. Most, about 2/3rd, said yes, half showed up, and Tina, we had a blast. What was funny was that I was surprised at how people long for community. They kept saying during the day, ""What are we going to do next...what's our next outing?"" I like learning mental and emotional awareness and applying immediately to see if it works and if I'm up for the challenge. Anyway, I highly recommend you read the 5-Second Rule if you haven't. I can walk up to anyone now.",0.9881
